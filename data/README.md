## Env Sample

`.env.sample` is a template for the environment variables required to run the project. Copy this file to `.env` and fill
in the necessary values.

## Resources.yaml

`resources.yaml` contains the configuration for the resources used in the project. It includes details such as resource
names, types, and any specific configurations needed for each resource. Simply add the resources you need to use in your
